# DSNLI-Project
Project for Data Science and Non-life insurance class by Dr. Antonio, where I follow [1]. Ultimately I chose to do GLM+GAM and random forest.

Throughout this project there are several notebooks, each represents a task that I had to do to complete the project. In each task-related subfolders, there is a file called *main* where I completed the task. You should read the *main* notebooks of each task-related subfolder in this order:
  * data_exploration
  * gam_binning
  * glm
  * random_trees
