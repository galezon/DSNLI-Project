To do:
    Check for interactions via barplots (Chapter 2).
    Set the reference class.
    Check which function can do mass AIC comparison.
    Use Berk et al's model agnostic coefficient for confidence intervals.
    Check for Negative Binomial GLM as well.
    Check for over-dispersion when using Poisson, maybe Quasi-Poisson?

    Do a lack of fit test, based on Statistical Modelling chapter 2.
    Check "accuracy" of the claim frequency predictions.
    Check "accuracy" of the claim amount given freq >= 1.
    Find an "accuracy" metric for the combination of both predictions.
